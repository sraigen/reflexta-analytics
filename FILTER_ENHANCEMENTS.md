## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### Database Integration:
- **Parameterized Queries**: All filters use proper SQL parameterization
- **Dynamic WHERE Clauses**: Filters dynamically build WHERE conditions
- **ID Mapping**: Proper mapping between display names and database IDs
- **Performance Optimization**: Cached queries with 60-second TTL

### Filter Processing:
```python
# Example: Finance Dashboard Filter Processing
dept_id = dept_mapping.get(selected_dept) if selected_dept != "All" else None
transaction_type = selected_type if selected_type != "All" else None
account_type = selected_account_type if selected_account_type != "All" else None
status = selected_status if selected_status != "All" else None
min_amount, max_amount = amount_range
```

### Query Enhancement:
```sql
-- Example: Enhanced Finance Query with Filters
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_transactions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'Revenue' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as total_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'Expense' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as total_expenses
FROM finance_transactions
WHERE transaction_date BETWEEN :from_dt AND :to_dt
    AND (:dept_id IS NULL OR dept_id = :dept_id)
    AND (:transaction_type IS NULL OR transaction_type = :transaction_type)
    AND (:status IS NULL OR status = :status)
    AND amount BETWEEN :min_amount AND :max_amount
```
